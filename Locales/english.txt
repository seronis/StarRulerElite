#doc res title: Resources
#doc res text: There are many types of resources in the game. The main economic ones are:
#doc res note0 title: Ore
#doc res note0 text: #c:09f#Ore#c# represents the raw natural resources available for further refinery. Ore is present at game start in large quantities on planets, where it is mined into #c:09f#metals#c# by #c:0fa#metal mining complexes#c#.\n\nLater in the game, ore can also be #c:f90#mined from asteroids#c# by equipping ships with the #c:0fa#mining beam#c#.
#doc res note1 title: Metals
#doc res note1 text: #c:09f#Metals#c# are the refined alloys used to build hulls and constructions. They are the easiest resource to produce and are required in large quantities for ship construction.\n\nMetals are refined from #c:09f#ore#c# by #c:0fa#metal mining complexes#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#metal refinery#c# sub system.
#doc res note2 title: Electronics
#doc res note2 text: #c:09f#Electronics#c# are more sophisticated forms of equipment. They represent the wiring and general systems required for advanced technology to function.\n\nElectronics are produced from #c:09f#metals#c#. Each unit of electronics requires #c:f90#two units of metals#c# to produce.\n\nElectronics are created by #c:0fa#electronics factories#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#electronics fabricator#c# sub system.
#doc res note3 title: Advanced Parts
#doc res note3 text: #c:09f#Advanced Parts#c# are the components needed for complex technological systems to function.\n\nAdvanced Parts are produced from #c:09f#metals#c# and #c:09f#electronics#c#. Each unit of advanced parts requires #c:f90#one unit of metals#c# and #c:f90#one unit of electronics#c#.\n\n\Advanced Parts are created by #c:0fa#advanced parts factories#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#advanced parts assembler#c# sub system.
#doc res note4 title: Food
#doc res note4 text: In order for your population to #c:f90#survive or even grow#c#, your people require #c:09f#food#c#.\n\nFood is produced by #c:0fa#farms#c# on planets, their effectiveness determined by your #c:0fa#Biology#c# technology level.\n\nIf you run out of food, your people may die and you will start losing planets to famine.
#doc res note5 title: General Goods
#doc res note5 text: #c:09f#Goods#c# are the basic items required for your population to have a satisfying lifestyle.\n\nLacking goods will greatly reduce the #c:09f#mood#c# of the population on your planets, which has disastrous effects on your economy as a whole.\n\nGoods are produced by #c:0fa#general goods factories#c# on planets.
#doc res note6 title: Luxuries
#doc res note6 text: #c:09f#Luxuries#c# are any non-essential goods your population consumes in the pursuit of their happiness.\n\nHaving sufficient luxuries will greatly increase the #c:09f#mood#c# of the population on your planets, which has beneficial effects on your economy as a whole.\n\nLuxuries are produced by #c:0fa#luxuries factories#c# on planets.
#doc res note7 title: Labor
#doc res note7 text: Each of your planets produces a certain amount of #c:09f#labor#c#. Labor is used to put resources together and create the final product that is being constructed.\n\nLabor is generated by #c:f90#population#c# and by #c:0fa#shipyards#c# on a planet.\n\nLabor can only be used on the planet it is generated on.
#doc pri title: Economic Principles
#doc pri text: The basic principles involved in the workings of the economy:
#doc pri note0 title: Stored Resources
#doc pri note0 text: Each planet has its own #c:f90#individual stored resources#c#. Only the resources stored on a planet may be used to construct #c:09f#ships#c# and #c:09f#structures#c#.\n\nWhile a planet is selected, the amount of resources present can be seen in the right section of the #c:09f#object information panel#c# at the bottom of the screen.
#doc pri note1 title: Galactic Bank
#doc pri note1 text: The #c:09f#galactic bank#c# is your empire's global resource pool. #c:0fa#Space ports#c# constructed on planets can import and export stored resources to and from the galactic bank at a certain rate, and are an important part of moving resources through your empire.\n\nThe current stored amounts in the galactic bank can be seen in the top left panel.
#doc pri note2 title: Bank Resources
#doc pri note2 text: The galactic bank can store #c:09f#Advanced Parts#c#, #c:09f#Electronics#c#, #c:09f#Metals#c#, #c:09f#Food#c#, #c:09f#Goods#c# and #c:09f#Luxuries#c#.\n\nGoods and Luxuries are not transported to and from the bank by #c:0fa#space ports#c#, but are instead produced into and consumed directly from the galactic bank.
#doc pri note3 title: Bank Rates
#doc pri note3 text: To the right of the galactic bank display in the top left are two buttons.\n\nThe top button toggles the bank display between #c:f90#currently stored resources#c# and #c:f90#average income rate per second#c#.\n\nThe lower button opens the #c:09f#economy report window#c#, displaying income and expense rates in more detail.
#doc pri note4 title: Blockades
#doc pri note4 text: Systems with an overwhelming amount of enemies are considered #c:09f#blockaded#c#. Resources cannot be ferried to and from space ports due to enemy interference and as such, any access to the galactic bank within the solar system is disabled.\n\nTo lift the blockade, bring in combat ships of your own to prevent the enemy from blockading.
#doc pri note5 title: Economy Report
#doc pri note5 text: The economy report window displays statistics for each resource.\n\n#c:0fa#Net#c# indicates the net change in your stores per second.\n#c:0fa#Income#c# is how much your economy produces per second.\n#c:0fa#Expenses#c# are your economy's actual consumptions per second.\n#c:0fa#Demand#c# is how many extra resources are needed per second to satisfy your empire's requirements.
#doc pri note6 title: Civil Acts
#doc pri note6 text: #c:09f#Civil Acts#c# are various decrees that you can issue to affect your empire's economy.\n\nCivil acts can be controlled from the #c:09f#civil acts window#c#, which can be accessed by pressing the #c:0f0#civil acts button#c# in the #c:09f#empire window#c#.
#doc pl before: Before you lies your #c:0fa#home planet#c#, the first of many planets that your empire will encompass.\n\n#c:09f#Planets#c# are a vital part of your economy, producing resources and constructing ships.\n\nIn this section of the docorial the various aspects of controlling your planets will be explained.
#doc pl title: Planets
#doc pl text: Forming the core of your economy, planets are vital to your success.
#doc pl note0 title: Colonization
#doc pl note0 text: The main aspect of empire expansion is #c:f90#colonization#c#. You will be building #c:0fa#colony ships#c# to settle on planets both in your home system and in others.\n\nA colony ship can only be used to colonize a single planet, and is used up in the process.
#doc pl note1 title: Structures and Slots
#doc pl note1 text: In order to make planets useful, you must build #c:09f#structures#c#.\n\nEach planet has a set amount of #c:09f#structure slots#c#, indicating the amount of structures that can be built on it.\n\nThe benefits provided by structures range from #c:f90#producing resources#c# to #c:f90#generating research points#c# and #c:f90#housing population#c#.
#doc pl note2 title: Governors
#doc pl note2 text: As emperor, you will not be commanding each individual structure to be built. Instead, you can assign #c:0fa#governor types#c# to each planet.\n\nThe planetary governor, when turned on, will #c:f90#automatically build appropriate structures#c#.
#doc pl note3 title: Population
#doc pl note3 text: Each planet has the capacity to house an amount of #c:f90#population#c#, depending on the amount of #c:0fa#cities#c# constructed on the planet and your #c:0fa#Sociology#c# technology level.\n\nPopulation is required to run other structures, and having more of it will increase your #c:f90#population work rate#c#, in turn increasing the amount of resources produced on your planet as a whole.
#doc pl note4 title: Mood
#doc pl note4 text: The population on a planet has a level of satisfaction with their living conditions, or #c:09f#mood#c#.\n\nMood is indicated by a number between -1.00 and +1.00. Lower numbers will #c:f90#impede resource and labor production#c#, while better moods will #c:f90#speed it up#c#.\n\nMood is dictated by your supplies of #c:0fa#food#c#, #c:0fa#general goods#c# and #c:0fa#luxury goods#c#, and can be affected when the planet is under attack.
#doc pl note5 title: Construction and Labor
#doc pl note5 text: Building #c:f90#ships#c# and #c:f90#structures#c# does not inherently take time to do. Instead, once all the #c:0fa#resources#c# required for the construction have been collected, and the #c:09f#labor#c# requirements are fulfilled, the project is completed.\n\nThe percentage complete indication on a construction project tells you how many of the resources have been collected for the construction so far.
#doc pl note6 title: Planetary Conditions
#doc pl note6 text: Every planet other than your homeworld has one or two #c:f90#planetary conditions#c# affecting its various statistics.\n\nPlanetary conditions can alter the effectiveness of your factories, the amount of damage your structures can take before succumbing to bombardment, and more.\n\nFor a detailed list of all the possible planetary conditions, please refer to the #c:09f#stellar-pedia#c#.
#doc pl note7 title: Population Work Rate
#doc pl note7 text: The more population is present on a planet, the higher the #c:09f#population work rate#c#. The work rate is a straight multiplier to your base resource incomes, so having more population will increase your resource production by a great deal.\n\nThe population capacity of cities can be improved by leveling up #c:0fa#Sociology#c#, but make sure to have enough food or #c:0fa#Biology#c# tech before doing so, or your people will starve.
#doc pl note8 title: Mood Impact Factor
#doc pl note8 text: As the mood of your population goes up or down, so does the #c:09f#mood impact factor#c#. The impact factor displays how much your factories are producing compared to their base rate due to mood effects.\n\nA happier populace is a more productive populace.
#doc pl note9 title: Worker Efficiency
#doc pl note9 text: If you do not have sufficient population to staff all your structures, some structures will be taken offline, but your factories will operate at a reduced efficiency. If your population is lacking, the #c:09f#worker efficiency#c# indicates at what capacity your production structures are operating.\n\nIf this number goes below 100%, it may be a wise idea to build more cities or investigate your food stores.
#doc pl note10 title: Trade Capacity
#doc pl note10 text: Because your #c:0fa#space ports#c# have a limited trade rate per second, only so many resources can be imported or exported from the bank at a time.\n\nThe #c:09f#trade capacity#c# numbers indicate how much of the total trade rate you are using.\n\nIf you are frequently at the limit of your trade capacity, building more space ports can be advantageous.
#doc sys title: Solar Systems
#doc sys text: Systems are gravity wells formed around large stars or other objects. They contain planets, asteroids and various other stellar phenomena.
#doc sys note0 title: Stars
#doc sys note0 text: Most solar systems are based around singular or binary stars.\n\nAt sufficiently high technology levels, stars can be attacked and detonated, dealing devastating amounts of damage to all objects unfortunate enough to be in the system at the time.
#doc sys note1 title: Planets
#doc sys note1 text: Most systems contain a handful of planets that can colonized for resource production and ship construction.\n\nWhen attacking an enemy planet, dealing damage will cause #c:09f#population#c# and #c:09f#structures#c# to be killed or destroyed first. A planet with 0 population or 0 structures reverts to being uninhabited and can be re-colonized.\n\nWhen a planet runs out of its own #c:09f#HP#c#, it explodes.
#doc sys note2 title: Asteroids
#doc sys note2 text: A good amount of systems will contain one or several asteroid belts. There are even systems in the form of entire asteroid fields.\n\nAsteroids can be mined for ore by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#mining laser#c# sub system.\n\nWhen an asteroid runs out of ore, it is destroyed.
#doc sys note3 title: System Plane
#doc sys note3 text: Each system has a grid indicating its xz-plane. The plane is helpful to indicate the height of ships in the system, and can serve as a target to create move orders on.\n\nThe thickest lines on the plane form a 1AU by 1AU grid to aid you in determining distances.
#doc sys note4 title: Strength Indicators
#doc sys note4 text: Around the system plane are bars indicating the strength of that empire in the system they encircle.\n\nThe more military you have in a system, the more pips will be displayed in your color.
#doc bp title: Blueprints
#doc bp text: Decides capabilities and behavior of ships.
#doc bp note0 title: Ship Scale
#doc bp note0 text: Every blueprint in the game has an assigned #c:f90#scale#c#.\n\nShip scale is a number ranging from the minimum scale to infinity, with larger numbers making for larger ships once the blueprint has been constructed.\n\nBigger ships will have much higher stats and fare better at many tasks, but will also be disproportionally more expensive to build until you level up the #c:0fa#mega construction#c# technology.
#doc bp note1 title: Hulls
#doc bp note1 text: Each blueprint must have exactly one #c:f90#hull#c# added as a sub system to the layout.\n\nThe hull takes an amount of all incoming damage and decides how much #c:09f#sub system space#c# you have to place sub systems in.\n\nFor example, the #c:0fa#light hull#c# has fewer hitpoints and lets through more damage, but provides an extra space slot to add a sub system in.
#doc bp note2 title: Sub System Size
#doc bp note2 text: Like ships, when you place a sub system on a blueprint you can give it a particular #c:f90#size#c#, ranging from #c:0fa#0.25 to 4.0#c#.\n\nThe size of a sub system is how much #c:09f#sub system space#c# it takes up on the hull.\n\nFor overall effectiveness, sub system size is #c:f90#relative to hull scale#c#: a size 0.25 weapon on a scale 40 ship will be as effective as a size 1.0 weapon on a scale 10 ship.
#doc bp note3 title: Armor
#doc bp note3 text: Many ships will also be equipped with layers of #c:f90#armor#c#.\n\nArmor is mounted on the outside of the ship, and does not take up any space on the hull.\n\nIt is possible to add as much armor as you like to any ship. Be warned however, as armor weighs and costs a lot, and will slow down your ship's movement and construction considerably.
#doc bp note4 title: Sub System Modifiers
#doc bp note4 text: Certain sub systems belong to a category called #c:f90#modifiers#c#. These sub systems do very little on their own, but can be #c:0fa#'linked'#c# to particular types of other sub systems to provide a boost to it.\n\nLinking sub systems is done automatically when placing a link on the blueprint to #c:f90#overlap#c# with another sub system.
#doc bp note5 title: Engines and Acceleration
#doc bp note5 text: In order to move, ships require #c:09f#engines#c#. An engine provides a particular amount of #c:0fa#thrust#c#, which is divided by the combined #c:0fa#mass#c# of all the sub systems on the ship to determine the ship's #c:09f#acceleration#c#.\n\nShips with a higher acceleration will get to their destinations faster and will be more maneuverable in combat.
#doc bp note6 title: Control
#doc bp note6 text: In order for ship sub systems to function, #c:09f#control#c# is required. Control represents the intelligent input provided by humans on a #c:0fa#bridge#c# or control conduits leading from a #c:0fa#computer core#c#.\n\nWithout control, sub systems that need it will go offline one by one. When control runs out entirely, the ship becomes #c:f90#inactive#c# and spend the rest of its time drifting meaninglessly through space until it decays.
#doc bp note7 title: Taking Damage
#doc bp note7 text: When a ship takes damage from enemy weapons fire, the following procedure is follows:\n\n- First, #c:f90#shields#c# and then #c:f90#armor#c# attempt to absorb the damage.\n- If it pierces those, the #c:f90#hull absorbs#c# a percentage of the damage and applies it to itself.\n - Any damage left over after this is #c:f90#applied to the sub systems#c# positioned closest to the direction the ship was hit from.
#doc tech title: Research
#doc tech text: Improve and unlock sub systems and structures.
#doc tech note0 title: Technologies
#doc tech note0 text: The types of fields you can study are represented by a number of #c:09f#technologies#c#, all positioned relatively to each other in the #c:09f#technology web#c#. Related technologies are close to each other in the web.\n\nEvery technology has a current level, and spending time researching a particular technology will eventually cause it to #c:f90#level up#c#, benefiting all related sub systems.
#doc tech note1 title: Research Points
#doc tech note1 text: Leveling up a technology requires a certain amount of #c:09f#research points#c# to be put into it.\n\nAs an empire you have a #c:09f#research rate#c#, being the amount of research points generated and put into the active technology by your empire every second.\n\nTo increase your research rate, build #c:0fa#science lab#c# structures on planets.
#doc tech note2 title: Hunches and Guesses
#doc tech note2 text: Each technology has a set of #c:09f#links#c# leading from it to other technologies. These links take the form of #c:0fa#hunches and guesses#c# associated with the field.\n\nHunches and guesses, like technologies, require #c:09f#research points#c#. Unlike technologies, however, they do not level up.\n\nWhen you've researched a link to a currently unknown technology, it #c:f90#becomes available for research#c#.
#doc tech note3 title: Unlocking Sub Systems
#doc tech note3 text: To #c:09f#unlock#c# a sub system, you need to have the #c:f90#required tech level#c# in all the technologies it needs. When the requirements are met, the sub system automatically becomes available for use.\n\nSome sub systems require a single technology to be leveled up to unlock, whereas other may require #c:0fa#multiple technologies#c# to be at specific levels or higher.
#doc tech note4 title: Technology Scaling
#doc tech note4 text: As you level up your technologies, the effectiveness of you sub systems and structures becomes #c:0fa#exponentially#c# better. That is to say, for every tech level you gain in a technology, the related sub systems can become #c:f90#40% more effective#c#. As a result, it is important not to lag behind in advancement.\n\nEach further level of technology takes twice as long to research, so #c:f90#leveling up becomes progressively harder#c#.

#SP_Cat_CivilActs: "  Civil Acts"
#SP_CivilActs_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Civil Acts\n#hline##c##font#\nCivil acts are empire-wide dictates you pick and choose from. They affect many aspects of planetary life, from #link:h:sp:population##c:mood#mood#c##link# to #link:h:sp:economy##c:metal#metal production#c##link#.

#SP_Cat_PlanetGovernors: "  Planet Governors"
#SP_PlanetGovernors:#c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Planetary Governors\n\
#hline##font##c#\n\
Planetary governors are automated building lists distributed to planets.  The default governor that is used for new planets that you have freshly colonized is set in the Empire window located on the top-bar.  Note that this governor must be set in advance at this time for the new planet to receive your colonization instructions when the colony is founded.  You may change the governor attached to that planet, and any other planet, after the colony has been established.\n\
\n\
#c:0d0#How the lists work:#c#  The numbered list for every governor describes the priority of each line.  Each line is checked to make sure it has been executed; if it has, then it proceeds to the next priority in sequence from lowest number to highest.  It continues checking against those priorities forever (or until you turn off the governor).\n\
\n\
#img:sparks# What's "Weight"? #font# Weight is the likelihood that something will be picked to be built.  The higher the number, the more likely that structure will be picked.\n\
\n\
#font:frank_10i#Types of Planetary Governor\n\
#hline#\n\
\n\
#c:0f0##font:frank_12i#General Purpose Worlds#font##c#\n\
General Purpose Worlds are meant to be used on a galactic scale and shouldn't throw your economy into disarray if chosen as a default governor.  They are not incredibly effective due to their general nature but allow for your interstellar empire to have a stable backbone upon which you can then specialize.\n\

#font:frank_10b#Shields:#font# Shields are an energy-based protective shell that takes damage from all sides. As shields take damage, more and more will pass through the shields and hit the armor/hull. Shields have a natural regeneration rate. Shield Hardeners can be used to reduce how much damage leaks through a given layer of shielding.\n\n\
