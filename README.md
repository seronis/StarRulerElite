CURRENTLY FINISHED AND TESTED FEATURES

* Expanded empire color choices to 30 hues and 6 shades of gray
* [ and ] keys in the planet window are mapped as 'prev/next' planet buttons
* Fuel and Ammo have been added to the galactic bank
* Cities now store enough food to support their population for 30 seconds of game time
* Cities provide roughly 10% of the labor of a shipyard, but does not increase 'labor pool' value
* Capital buildings store enough food to support their population for 3 minutes
* Although there are a few exceptions, 'all' planet structures have been re-balanced to:
- have base construction cost of exactly 500 total materials spread between Mtl / Elec / AdvP
- have structure mass exactly equal its total materials
- require 5 labor per 500 materials used to construct
- Capital buildings, bunkers, and planetary weapons/engines have increased costs
* Subsystem min/max scales changed from 1/4th and 4, to 1/16th and 8
* you have finer scale control at low scales and less scale control at high scale sizes
* when starting a new game, the tabs of game options have been reorganized and defaults changed
* max galaxy size is now 32k instead of 8k with a default size of 6000 instead of 2000
* to help create a demand for Ammo and Fuel depot buildings, the base production of fuel/ammo in shipyards and spaceports was greatly reduced.
* An alternate shipyard building named "Universal Parts Yard" was added. This building produces SIGNIFICANTLY less labor per second but has a MASSIVE labor pool value at higher levels. This means its useful on planets that do not constantly produce ships but periodically receive an order and will used the stored labor to finish construction quite rapidly


Future Plans:

* Have recycled/scrapped/salvaged ships create either a new 'slag' resource or possibly just raw ore that can be processed slowly at Capitals or with special Recycling buildings
* Have the planetary electric factory and adv part factory buildings create the same slag/ore as a byproduct to make its 'total input mass' match 'total output mass'
* prevent metal mines from functioning on ring worlds
* consider having some planetary buildings consume 'fuel' as their power source so that fuel is still needed for empires that use bussard subsystems and matter generators.
* add fuel/ammo to trade options and as material costs in ship manufacturing
* offer 'empty' fuel/ammo storage containers so you can control whether the ship needs them as a construction cost or not
* create a system for System Banks to supplement the Galactic bank. 
- spaceports will import/export via the system bank from now on. 
- a small percentage of unused spaceport trade capacity will swap resources between system banks and the galactic bank
- a set of import / export dock subsystems will be added and ONLY allowed on station hulls that increase system/gb trade rates.
* total rewrite of colonizer system
* add 'Mothership' hull type meant for transporting (or just Housing) large populations in space
* create additional subsystems to allow for 'space colonies' on mother ships including food production, research, etc
* scripted governors with multiple tiers of targeted 'efficiency'. Govs will automatically get smarter the higher your tech research levels.
* AI empires will also use new govs. Their difficulty rating will allow them to get more efficient govs sooner. (should make 'cheat' option unneeded)
*
